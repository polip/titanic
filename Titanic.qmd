library(stringr)

```

## Import data


```{r}
train <- read_csv('train.csv' ) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

```{r}
train |> 
  count(survived)
```


```{r}
train |> 
  count(pclass)
```

```{r}
train_baked |> count(title, sort=T             )
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
train %>% glimpse()

plot_histogram(train)
plot_bar(train)
plot_missing(train)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
```{r}
plot_histogram(train)

```
